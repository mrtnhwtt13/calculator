# calculator
A scientific calculator made with Python. 
On a basic level it can only make basic operation, such as addition, substraction, multiplication and substraction with only two numbers. 1 +2 for example.
For more complexe calculation a custom made order of operation decoder was made using recursion. Thus it is capable of solving operations like (9*(3+5*7))/53.
